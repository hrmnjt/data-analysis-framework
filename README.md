# Data Analysis Boilerplate

---

## What is this?
A light-weight folder structure serving as starting point for data-analysis projects 
to helps maintain consistency and code-quality.
This structure inspired from 
[Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project while
personalizing a few things here and there.

## What this is not?
 * Ideal - this is highly personalised for my use. Please feel free to fork and alter as per your need
 * Finalized - since I'm evolving as I learn stuff, this repo is too!
